nojax.js
=========

Convert plain HTML links to instead use AJAX automatically. See nojax.org for more info.

As an alternative to clicking on a link and having it load as a completely new page, with wrival.js, the link can instead fetch the request and put its content into an existing element of your choice (such as a div). It simply changes what a link's "target" attribute can be used for and does the AJAX automatically in the background for you. Also works for forms, images, swapping content already within the current page, and has built-in options for updating browser history.

Allows for super fast and easy AJAX website and mobile app development using plain old HTML.
